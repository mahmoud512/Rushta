My graduation project won the Excellence Award. The idea of ​​the project is based on technological transformation to replace traditional paper prescription records for patients with electronic records that have many benefits that enhance the health and safety of patients. The project consists of four users: patients, a pharmacist, a doctor, and an employee who reports to the doctor Each user has his own system
#The website records the patient's medical history from the moment they enter the system. It
captures all patient data, such as chronic diseases and medications, to facilitate diagnosis by the
physician.
#The system also records each visit to the doctor and allows for adding notes about the patient,
ensuring that all patient data is stored for future reference.
#Additionally, the system enables patients to make online appointments with doctors or
hospitals.
#Additionally, patients can electronically send prescriptions to nearby pharmacies, and the
system indicates whether the pharmacy offers delivery services or not
